Twitter sentiment analysis

## Data Collection
Obtain labeled data (VADER) - done

Unlabeled tweets (1 million) - get

Self-collected tweets (few thousand tweets relate to predefined topics) - get

## Data Cleaning
Pre-processing - done

Stemming - done

Removal of repeated word - done

Feature Extraction for NN- done

Feature Extraction for Bayes - SVM - done

04/10: I realised the importance of feature extraction in NLP.
I can't get over 61% acc, so working on advanced feature extractions.... 

## Classification and Evaluation
Classifier Training and optimisation

NBayes - Johnny, 60% acc, not good :<

SVM - Jeesup

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 

Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

### Evaluation 
Produce confusion matrix
precision/recall - function available for sklearn predictors
